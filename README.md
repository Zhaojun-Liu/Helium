## Introduction

This project is inspired by [Fallen-Breath/MCDReforged](https://github.com/Fallen-Breath/MCDReforged). We would like to express our sincere thanks to all contributors to the project.

Helium is a extension system for Minecraft servers and it doesn't need any modify or modding to work on 
diverse Minecraft servers. Besides, Helium also provides built-in flexible script system and a extension manager(Just like the apt). Helium uses the dlls as extensions, which means you can use any language that can write dlls and cooperate with C++, such as C, C# or Java, to write Helium extensions.

Helium is based on C++, which means Helium is lightweight and incredibly fast. But as a trade-off, based the C++ also means poor binary portability and relatively poor maintainability. If portability is important to you, you may like to use [Fallen-Breath/MCDReforged](https://github.com/Fallen-Breath/MCDReforged) instead of using Helium.

For now Helium only supports Windows(x64), but we are planning to make a Linux version.

If you find any bugs or want to contact us, [Our mail](mailto:helium_devteam@outlook.com).
