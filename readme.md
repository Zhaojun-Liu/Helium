# Helium
Helium is a customizable extension system for Minecraft server which is written in C++.
This project is inspired by the [Fallen-Breath/MCDReforged](https://github.com/Fallen-Breath/MCDReforged).
We target to provide a liter, faster, and more customizable choice.
As a trade-off, we sacrifice its portability and the simplicity of writing extensions.
(we r sry that we haven't finish the first alpha version yet, if u r interested in our project, we recommend u to use mcdr as a temporary alternative)
